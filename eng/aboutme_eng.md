![Mi sides](https://rvalla.github.io/assets/img/aboutme.jpg)

I train myself to be creative all the time. And as creativity does not distinguish among disciplines, I do it
doing a lot of things. I study music and math. I have written for years. I bake my own bread every week.
Computers are part of my training. I write code to ask myself, to think, to design tools which help me with
what I do. I use them to edit my photos too.


The patience needed to find a bug in a program's code is the same needed to expect the light to be perfect
for a photograph or a bread to ferment. The capacity to see with a creative sense the problem I try to solve
is the same I use to imagine the picture I want, to write a musical piece which is a game at he same time,
to conceive a crazy character for a story.


I was born in Buenos Aires in 1986 and have lived in Argentina since then. In 1996 I entered the [Argentine
School for Inventors](https://escueladeinventores.blogspot.com/). I studied orchestral conducting in
[National University of Arts](https://una.edu.ar/), I studied a bit of math too. But I am learning new stuff
every week so, my transit trough school and college doesn't give you a precise idea of who I am.


## My other sides

In this site I share the results of my hours writing code. Perhaps you are interested in my work in other fields.
If that is the case I invite you to escape from my *algorithmic side* and look for my other sides:

- My work as photographer is [here](https://rodrigovalla.com). The site is in spanish, if that is a problem maybe
you can go to my [flickr profile](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pdelaignorancia/).
- If you like stochastic music you can listen to my [musical games](https://vimeo.com/showcase/4825357).
- If you can read in spanish and like literature you can visit [Percepciones de la ignorancia](https://pdelaignorancia.com).
