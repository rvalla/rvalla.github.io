Programming gives me the chance to implement from musical analysis tools to a software to track a card position

However, It is more likely that they only serve to make you hesitate and learn. That is what happens to me.

## COVID-19
The year 2020 highlights once again the fragility of human life and its social organization. But in a time
when we have access to a lot of data almost instantly. In part as excuse to start programming in
[Python](https://www.python.org/) I wrote a series of small programs to be able to visualize data on the
evolution of the epidemic around the world and especially in Argentina...
