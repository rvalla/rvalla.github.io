title:  algorithmic Me
---

In this site I share my algorithmic side. I don't make a living writing code but I know how to do it.
Programming gives me the chance to implement from musical analysis tools to a software to track a card position
in a poker deck when a magician does a Faro shuffle.


It is possible that some of the projects I am working on are useful for you. Maybe they can help you to solve a
problem you have (such as deciding if a chord can be played on a violin) or to teach cryptography in a class.
However, It is more likely that they only serve to make you hesitate and learn. That is what happens to me.

  
You can know more about who I am [here](https://rvalla.github.io/eng/aboutme_eng/) or reach me by
[mail](mailto:rodrigovalla@protonmail.ch) (I am on [telegram](https://t.me/rvalla) and
<a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@rvalla">mastodon</a> too).

### COVID-19
The year 2020 highlights once again the fragility of human life and its social organization. But in a time
when we have access to a lot of data almost instantly. In part as excuse to start programming in
[Python](https://www.python.org/) I wrote a series of small programs to be able to visualize data on the
evolution of the epidemic around the world and especially in Argentina...

A [blog](https://rvalla.github.io/eng/blog_eng/) where I write mostly about things related to the projects I share here, without much care. I will
intend to write brief posts although is possible I can not always acomplish that. I'm going to try to group
the posts into five categories. Here is the [rss feed](https://rvalla.github.io/feed_eng.xml).

### categories:

- reality
- music
- tools
- teaching
- data analyisis
